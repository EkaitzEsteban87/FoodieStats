  FoodieStats is a dedicated statistical module designed for gastronomy
  professionals, nutritionists and high-performance athletes. This module covers
  a range of critical aspects in food and beverage product development.
  </br></br> * <b>Food and Beverage Product Formulation</b> - Contains
  experimental design methods used in the creation of food and beverage products
  and their practical application within the food industry. </br></br> *
  <b>Sensory and Consumer Data</b> - Integrates methods and tools for in-depth
  sensory and consumer data analysis, emphasizing measurement scales,
  sensometrics, and various data collection methods. </br></br> * <b>Food
  Control and Machine Learning</b> - Includes food control and machine learning
  approaches to advance product development in the realm of gastronomy.
  </br></br> * <b>Food Science and Nutrition</b> - Utilizes health-focused
  analytics to optimize nutritional content.
